// Converting a byte array to a Base32 encoded string involves several steps. Here is a step-by-step guide to help you through the process:

// Prepare your data: Obtain the byte array you want to convert to Base32.

// Padding: Determine if padding is needed. Base32 encoding works with 5-bit groups, which means that the input length should be divisible by 5. If not, add padding (0 bits) to the end of the byte array to make its length a multiple of 5.

// Bit manipulation: Read the byte array and process it in groups of 5 bits. For each group, extract the 5 bits and convert them into a single integer value ranging from 0 to 31.

// Mapping: Map the integer values obtained in step 3 to the corresponding Base32 characters. The Base32 character set consists of 32 characters: A-Z and 2-7. Here is the index mapping:

// 0 -> A, 1 -> B, ..., 25 -> Z, 26 -> 2, 27 -> 3, ..., 31 -> 7

// Concatenate: Concatenate the mapped characters to form the Base32 encoded string.

// Add padding characters (optional): If you need to preserve the length of the encoded data, append padding characters '=' to the end of the encoded string. The number of padding characters should be equal to 8 minus the remainder of the length of the encoded string divided by 8.
